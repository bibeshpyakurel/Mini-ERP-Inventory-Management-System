# ClearERP

A full-stack multi-tenant ERP system demonstrating inventory management, procurement workflows, and operational reporting across six industry verticals. Built as a portfolio project showcasing enterprise application architecture with .NET and React.

---

## What is ClearERP?

ClearERP simulates the inventory and purchasing workflows found in real ERP systems used by manufacturing, warehousing, and operations-driven companies. Unlike generic CRUD demos, it implements the business logic that matters in production ERP software:

- **Traceable stock movements** with full transaction history
- **Multi-step procurement workflows** (draft → approve → receive)
- **Multi-tenant isolation** with per-company data separation
- **Role-based access control** (Admin, Inventory Manager, Warehouse Staff)
- **Operational reporting** with KPIs and low-stock alerts
- **Complete audit trail** for compliance and accountability

---

## Demo-First Design

This project is built for immediate evaluation. There's no complex setup, no account provisioning, and no database seeding required.

**Start the app and sign in** — everything works out of the box.

Each of the six demo companies comes pre-loaded with:
- Items, categories, and suppliers
- Purchase orders in various stages
- Inventory balances and transaction history
- Role-appropriate user accounts

The login page offers **quick-fill buttons** that auto-populate credentials, making it trivial to explore different companies and roles.

## Multi-Tenant Architecture

ClearERP demonstrates enterprise multi-tenancy: each company operates in complete isolation with its own data, users, and business context.

| Company | Industry | Focus Area |
|---------|----------|------------|
| **ClearFurniture Corp** | Furniture Manufacturing | Office furniture components and finished goods |
| **TechFlow Electronics** | Electronics | Circuit boards, components, and assemblies |
| **FreshFoods Co** | Food & Beverage | Perishable inventory with shelf-life management |
| **CloudPeak SaaS** | SaaS / Cloud | Software licenses and hardware assets |
| **NetBridge IT Services** | IT Services | Network equipment and service materials |
| **ShieldCore Cybersecurity** | Cybersecurity | Security appliances and monitoring tools |

This showcases how a single ERP platform adapts to fundamentally different business contexts — a key architectural decision in real-world enterprise software.

```

### Clean Architecture

The backend follows **Clean Architecture** principles with four distinct layers:

- **Domain** — Core business entities, value objects, and domain logic
- **Application** — Use cases, service interfaces, DTOs, and business rules
- **Infrastructure** — EF Core, database access, JWT token generation, external services
- **API** — Controllers, request/response contracts, validation, middleware

### Frontend Architecture

The React frontend uses a feature-based structure:

- **React 19** with TypeScript for type safety
- **React Router** for client-side navigation
- **TanStack Query** for server state management
- **React Hook Form** with Zod validation
- **Material UI** for the component library

## Business Workflows

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication with role claims
- Tenant-scoped data isolation via global query filters
- Three role levels: Admin, Inventory Manager, Warehouse Staff

### 2. Item Master Management
- Create and maintain inventory items
- Assign categories, SKUs, units, and costs
- Set reorder thresholds for low-stock alerts
- Activate/deactivate items without deletion

### 3. Supplier Management
- Maintain supplier directory with contact info
- Map suppliers to the items they provide
- Track supplier-specific SKUs

### 4. Purchase Order Lifecycle
- **Draft** — Create and edit before submission
- **Approved** — Ready for receiving
- **Partially Received** — Some goods received
- **Completed** — Fully received
- **Cancelled** — Order cancelled

### 5. Goods Receipt
- Receive inventory against approved POs
- Select destination warehouse and location
- Automatic inventory balance updates
- Transaction audit trail

### 6. Inventory Operations
- View real-time balances by item/warehouse
- Issue stock for operational consumption
- Adjust stock for corrections, damage, or cycle counts
- Full transaction history with reasons

### 7. Reporting & Analytics
- Dashboard KPIs and trend indicators
- Low-stock alerts based on reorder levels
- Stock valuation reports
- Purchase order summaries
- Recent transaction activity

### 8. Audit Logging
- Track key actions: logins, purchases, receipts, adjustments
- Immutable audit trail for compliance
- Admin-accessible audit log viewer

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 22+**
- **.NET 9 SDK**
- **PostgreSQL 16**
- **Docker** (optional, for containerized setup)

### Quick Start with Docker

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/bibeshpyakurel/ClearERP.git
cd ClearERP

# Copy environment files
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env.local

# Start all services
docker compose up --build
```

Open:
- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Backend API: http://localhost:5000
- Swagger: http://localhost:5000/swagger

### Local Development

**1. Start PostgreSQL**

```bash
# macOS with Homebrew
brew services start postgresql@16

# Or use Docker
docker run -d --name clearerp-db \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=clearerp \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=clearerp \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=clearerp \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  postgres:16
```

**2. Configure Environment**

```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env.local
```

**3. Run the Backend**

```bash
cd backend
dotnet restore
dotnet run --project src/ClearErp.Api
```

The backend will:
- Apply EF Core migrations automatically
- Seed all demo data on first run
- Listen on http://localhost:5000

**4. Run the Frontend**

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173

---

## API Documentation

With the backend running, explore the API at:

- **Swagger UI**: http://localhost:5000/swagger

### Testing the API

1. Call `POST /api/auth/login` with credentials
2. Copy the `accessToken` from the response
3. Click "Authorize" in Swagger
4. Enter: `Bearer <your-token>`
5. Explore endpoints:
   - `GET /api/items` — Item catalog
   - `GET /api/suppliers` — Supplier directory
   - `GET /api/categories` — Item categories
   - `GET /api/warehouses` — Warehouses with locations
   - `GET /api/inventory/balances` — Current stock levels
   - `GET /api/purchase-orders` — PO list
   - `GET /api/reports/stock-summary` — Stock summary
   - `GET /api/audit-logs` — Audit trail

---

## Testing

### Backend Tests

```bash
cd backend
dotnet test
```

Tests include:
- Unit tests for domain logic and services
- Integration tests with real PostgreSQL (via Testcontainers)

### Frontend Verification

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build    # Production build
npm run lint     # ESLint check
```

## Why ERP Across Industries?

ERP systems aren't one-size-fits-all. Different industries have fundamentally different:

| Industry | Key Challenge | ERP Focus |
|----------|--------------|-----------|
| **Manufacturing** | Bill of materials, production scheduling | Component tracking, work orders |
| **Electronics** | Rapid obsolescence, component variants | Revision control, lot tracking |
| **Food & Beverage** | Perishability, regulatory compliance | Shelf-life, batch traceability |
| **SaaS** | License management, subscription tracking | Asset management, renewals |
| **IT Services** | Project-based inventory, serial tracking | Equipment allocation, service items |
| **Cybersecurity** | Appliance deployment, firmware versions | Asset inventory, compliance tracking |

ClearERP demonstrates that **the same core ERP engine** — items, suppliers, procurement, inventory — adapts to serve any of these contexts. That's the architectural insight this project showcases.

---
